Leadership: When in search for a solution to a problem no matter how big or small it may appear, I am always eager to take action and not stand idly by. I was nominated by my teammates on my high school football team as a unit leader throughout my 2016-17 football season. I was to ensure that my unit most importantly always was aware who we played for, that it was never about “I” but about “us”. I am currently an active member in the Austin Community College Male Leadership club and partake in activities such as volunteering at the Central Texas Food Bank. I am also an active member of the Black Student Association in which we talk about world wide issues, then narrow it down to how we make Austin Community College a safe environment for all students. 	Teamwork: In both my C++ and python programming fundamentals classes, I was involved in group projects which emphasized on the importance of accountability, group work, and punctuality. Being a part of both football and track & field teams all throughout my fruitful years in high school has not just provided me with memories that will last me a lifetime, but given me insight on the best way to achieve a common goal, and that is through teamwork. I am inclined to work well with others because I have experienced a large variety of different personalities, friendship’s, leaderships and goals awaiting my arrival. 	Courteous: I strongly believe that I am a man of courtesy and that I have respect for the opinions of others. In high school when I was not expanding my knowledge in the classroom or improving my game on the field, I was tutoring some of the great young minds of Round Rock High School. Being an AVID tutor meant that I was dealing with students whom I was once in their shoes, meaning that I would need to level with them with the utmost respect, rather than act as an authority figure. 	Charisma: One thing that life has taught me is that your mood and persona are highly contagious. If a coach or teacher decides to slouch, look exhausted or have a look that he or she does not want to be here, that affects everyone around them. Others will start to feel the same way, begin having negative non-motivational thoughts, and put in less work, ultimately bringing them down as a whole. I believe that I am very charismatic because I carry a strong desire in me to get better and succeed each an everyday. I also believe that my will to succeed affects those around me, causing them to emulate my actions and ultimately provide a productive day for everyone. </div>References available on request</p>
