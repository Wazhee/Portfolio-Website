  <p>Akin Akinboro</p>  <p>akinboro@gmail.com</p>  <p>September 26, 2016</p><p>To whom it may concern,9 years, that’s how long I have observed Jason Uwaeze and seen him grow from a child into an amazing responsible young man; one that I am proud to recommend.I work with a number of youths at my church and around the city and Jason has a rear combination of talents and attitude that make him stand out.  Not only is he intelligent, he is responsible, loyal and a very deep thinker.  Jason isn’t one to follow the crowd, he evaluates his decisions and follows what he believes is best for him.  This ability has also made him an excellent leader.  Be it on the field with his teammates or with teens at church, I have seen repeatedly how others follow his leadership.  He doesn’t exert his will or opinion on anyone, but because of the way he carries himself, they follow.A couple of years ago, Jason lost his dad, who is also his best buddy.  During this time was when I saw one of the strongest display of strength from Jason.  He turned, what would be a legitimate excuse for many to feel dejected into fuel which propels him to succeed and honor the legacy of his dad.In school he is an A/B student; at church he mentors several under classmen and a captain of his football team.I know Jason will be an excellent addition to any College/University.  He is the type of student that will make the star of that institution shine brighter in integrity, talent and achievements.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>Akin Akinboro</p>
